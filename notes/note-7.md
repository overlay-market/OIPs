Issue to address with this note:

- How do we prevent payouts that would otherwise bankrupt the system? i.e. avoid becoming [Taleb's proverbial turkey](https://www.riskmanagementmonitor.com/lets-not-be-turkeys/)


## Context

Cap the payoffs.

Along with caps on open interest, means we can definitively calculate worst case amount system has to pay out at any moment.
